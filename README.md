# EU Capitals Quiz

EU Capitals Quiz is a fun and informative game. There are around 50 countries in total in Europe. But currently, there are only 27 countries that are members of the european Union. In this game, the player will be tested if they can successfully name the capitals of these 27 countries.

It is a multiple choice type of game where a player can only select one answer for every question. Each time the player clicks on the desired choice, the player cannot deselect or choose another answer. Each correct answer will be accumulated as the game progresses and the final total score will be shown at the end.
